⚡ Pulse – Unified Bill Payment & AutoPay on Aptos
📌 Project Description

Pulse is a decentralized bill management and payment system built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to consolidate all their monthly bills (utilities, subscriptions, EMIs, memberships, etc.) into one place and pay them securely using either one-click bulk payments or automated scheduling. By removing intermediaries and leveraging smart contracts, Pulse ensures faster, cheaper, and trustless recurring payments with full transparency.

🎯 Project Vision

Our vision is to simplify recurring payments by creating a single trustless platform that automates bill settlement for individuals and businesses. Instead of managing multiple platforms or missing due dates, users can set up autopay rules, receive alerts, and ensure seamless bill payments directly from their Aptos wallets. Pulse aims to become the go-to DeFi autopay system, offering both convenience and reliability for everyday financial life.
